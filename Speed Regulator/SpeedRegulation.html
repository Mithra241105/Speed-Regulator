        <p class="text-lg mb-4 text-left">
            The Vehicle Regulation System is designed to enhance road safety and compliance with traffic regulations. Each vehicle is equipped with a frequency receiving sensor, while roads are fitted with frequency senders for different zones. When a vehicle enters a specific zone, such as a speed zone or no horn zone, the system sends the relevant frequency to the vehicle. This ensures that the vehicle adheres to the speed limit and horn regulations of the zone.
